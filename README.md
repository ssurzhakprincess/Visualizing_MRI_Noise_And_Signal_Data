As a Data Science intern at Promaxo, I developed an application that allows users 
to visualize the signal and noise data from Promaxo’s MRI systems through dynamic, 
interactive graphs. As a part of the application, I designed and implemented an 
outlier detection pipeline that analyzes MRI noise amplitude in the frequency domain 
and applies threshold-based criteria. This pipeline was integrated into Promaxo’s 
internal software for automated noise detection, helping to reduce data analysis time 
and effort by over 20%.
